I'll help you search for literature on robot sim2real transfer evaluation methods that don't require real-world deployment. Let's start with a search to find relevant research.

Based on this first search, I see several papers discussing sim2real transfer, but I need to specifically search for methods that evaluate sim2real transfer without real-world deployment. Let me continue searching with a more focused query.



I've found some relevant papers on measuring the sim2real gap, but I need to search specifically for methods that estimate sim2real transfer capabilities without real-world deployment. Let me do another search to find more focused literature.



Now let me search one more time specifically for evaluation tools and predictors of simulation-to-reality transfer success without the need for real-world testing.



Based on my searches, I'll now provide a comprehensive review of methods to estimate a robot reinforcement learning policy's sim2real transfer ability without deploying it in the real world.

# Estimating Sim2Real Transfer Ability Without Real-World Deployment: A Literature Review

## Introduction

The sim2real gap in robotics refers to the discrepancy between a policy's performance in simulation versus the real world. While training reinforcement learning (RL) policies in simulation offers advantages like safety, cost-effectiveness, and data efficiency, transferring these policies to real robots remains challenging. This review focuses on methods to evaluate and predict sim2real transfer success without requiring physical deployment.

## Key Metrics and Evaluation Methods

### 1. Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient (SRCC)

Researchers at Facebook AI developed the "Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient" (SRCC) to quantify a simulator's predictivity of real-world performance. This approach involves:

- Creating a digital replica of a physical testing environment
- Testing multiple models in both simulation and reality
- Calculating correlation between simulation and real-world performance

While this method initially requires some real-world testing to establish the correlation, once established, SRCC can be used to predict how well future policies would transfer without additional real-world testing.

### 2. Simulation Optimization Bias (SOB)

The Simulation Optimization Bias (SOB) is "a quantitative measure for the transferability of a control policy from a set of source domains to a different target domain originating from the same distribution." It provides:

- A Monte Carlo estimator to predict transferability
- An upper confidence bound that can serve as a training stopping criterion
- A measure that decreases with an increasing number of simulated domains

This approach allows researchers to predict the policy's real-world performance purely from simulation data.

### 3. Domain Randomization Evaluation

Several methodologies evaluate policies trained under domain randomization:

- Measuring policy robustness across randomized simulations
- Testing performance degradation with increasing parameter randomization
- Evaluating policy behavior in deliberately challenging simulation scenarios

These evaluations help quantify how well a policy might generalize to the real world's inherent variations.

### 4. Latent Space Analysis

Tools like Sim2RealViz employ "multiple-coordinated views" to analyze the sim2real gap through visualizations of latent spaces, comparing model performances using various metrics. This approach:

- Visualizes the distribution of policy behaviors in latent space
- Identifies regions of the state space where the policy might struggle in reality
- Analyzes how the policy adapts to different simulated conditions

### 5. Fidelity Paradox Assessment

Contrary to intuition, research shows that "lower fidelity simulation leads to higher sim2real transfer in navigation" in some cases. This suggests evaluating policies by:

- Testing performance across simulators of varying fidelity
- Assessing overfitting to simulator-specific features
- Measuring robustness to simplified physics models

## Predictive Techniques

### 1. System Identification Quality

Some methods focus on "system identification for aligning the simulation environment as far as possible with the dynamics of a real robot" before learning begins. The quality of this alignment can predict transfer success by:

- Measuring the discrepancy between simulated and real-world system responses
- Analyzing the sensitivity of the policy to system identification errors
- Quantifying uncertainty in the simulation parameters

### 2. Cross-Validation Between Simulators

Testing policies across different simulators can help predict real-world transferability. If a policy performs well across multiple simulation environments with different physics engines and rendering techniques, it's more likely to transfer successfully.

### 3. Synthetic-to-Real Image Transfer Assessment

For vision-based policies:

- Evaluating the policy on simulation images processed to look more realistic
- Testing on real images processed to look like simulation images
- Measuring performance on intermediate domain-adapted images

### 4. Adversarial Testing

Deliberately challenging policies with:
- Simulated sensor noise and delays
- Unexpected environmental perturbations
- Controller response variations

### 5. Transfer Learning Metrics

Some approaches use "natural language descriptions of images as a unifying signal across domains" to bridge the sim2real visual gap. These methods:

- Measure the alignment between simulated and real feature spaces
- Quantify the domain gap using discriminator-based metrics
- Evaluate feature transferability using proxy tasks

## Conclusion

While no method provides perfect prediction of sim2real transfer without some real-world testing, these approaches offer valuable insights into a policy's potential real-world performance before deployment. The most reliable strategies often combine multiple techniques and focus on identifying potential failure modes rather than just measuring average performance.

For researchers seeking to predict sim2real transfer, I recommend:
1. Using SRCC with limited initial real-world testing to calibrate simulation parameters
2. Employing SOB to estimate transfer performance from purely simulation data
3. Conducting thorough domain randomization evaluation
4. Analyzing policy behavior in latent space
5. Testing across multiple simulators of varying fidelity
