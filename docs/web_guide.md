Okay, I can help you set up your repository to be published as a website using GitHub Pages, where your Markdown folders become navigation menus.

We'll use a tool called **MkDocs**, a popular static site generator that's great for building project documentation from Markdown files. It works well with GitHub Pages.

Here’s a step-by-step guide:

**1. Install MkDocs**

You'll need Python and pip installed. Then, install MkDocs and a popular theme like Material for MkDocs:

```bash
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
```

**2. Set up MkDocs Configuration**

*   Create a configuration file named `mkdocs.yml` in the root of your repository. This file tells MkDocs about your site.

    ```yaml
    # mkdocs.yml
    site_name: Awesome Humanoid Robotics # Or your desired site title
    theme:
      name: material # Use the Material theme
    # Optional: Add plugins or custom CSS/JS here if needed
    # Optional: Explicitly define navigation if the automatic structure isn't right
    # nav:
    #   - Home: index.md
    #   - Folder 1:
    #     - Page 1.1: folder1/page1.1.md
    #     - Page 1.2: folder1/page1.2.md
    #   - Folder 2: folder2/index.md
    ```

    *   Replace `Awesome Humanoid Robotics` with your preferred site title.
    *   MkDocs automatically creates navigation based on your folder structure in the `docs` directory (see next step). You usually don't *need* the `nav:` section unless you want precise control over the order or titles.

**3. Organize Your Content**

*   Create a directory named `docs` in the root of your repository.
*   **Move all your Markdown files and folders** that you want to be part of the website *into* this `docs` directory.
*   Make sure you have an `index.md` file in the `docs` directory; this will be your site's homepage. If you don't have one, your `README.md` might be a good starting point (copy `README.md` to `docs/index.md`).

Your repository structure should look something like this:

```
.
├── docs/
│   ├── index.md         # Your homepage content
│   ├── folder1/
│   │   ├── page1.md
│   │   └── page2.md
│   └── folder2/
│       ├── another_page.md
│       └── index.md     # Optional index for the folder
├── mkdocs.yml
└── .github/             # We'll create this next
    └── workflows/
        └── ci.yml       # We'll create this next
# Other files like .gitignore, LICENSE etc. can remain at the root
```

**4. Preview Locally (Optional but Recommended)**

*   Open your terminal in the repository root.
*   Run `mkdocs serve`.
*   Open your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` (or the address shown in the terminal).
*   You should see your site! Check if the navigation menus match your `docs` folder structure. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

**5. Set up GitHub Actions for Automatic Deployment**

*   Create the directory path `.github/workflows/` if it doesn't exist.
*   Create a file named `ci.yml` (or any `.yml` name) inside `.github/workflows/` with the following content:

    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/ci.yml
    name: Deploy MkDocs site to GitHub Pages

    on:
      push:
        branches:
          - main # Or your default branch (e.g., master)
      # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
      workflow_dispatch:

    # Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
    permissions:
      contents: read
      pages: write
      id-token: write

    # Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
    # However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
    concurrency:
      group: "pages"
      cancel-in-progress: false

    jobs:
      deploy:
        environment:
          name: github-pages
          url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - name: Set up Python
            uses: actions/setup-python@v5
            with:
              python-version: 3.x
          - name: Install dependencies
            run: pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material
          - name: Build MkDocs site
            run: mkdocs build # Builds the site into a 'site' directory
          - name: Setup Pages
            uses: actions/configure-pages@v4
          - name: Upload artifact
            uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
            with:
              # Upload the 'site' directory generated by mkdocs build
              path: './site'
          - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
            id: deployment
            uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
    ```

**6. Configure GitHub Pages in Repository Settings**

*   Go to your repository on GitHub.
*   Click on "Settings" > "Pages".
*   Under "Build and deployment", select "Source" as "GitHub Actions".

**7. Commit and Push**

*   Commit the new `mkdocs.yml` file, the `docs` directory (with your moved content), and the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file.
*   Push these changes to your main branch on GitHub.

```bash
git add mkdocs.yml docs/ .github/
git commit -m "Configure MkDocs for GitHub Pages"
git push origin main # Or your default branch name
```

**How it Works:**

*   When you push to your main branch, the GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) automatically triggers.
*   It checks out your code, installs MkDocs, builds the static HTML site from your Markdown files in `docs/` into a `site/` directory.
*   The workflow then uploads this `site/` directory as a GitHub Pages artifact.
*   Finally, it deploys this artifact to GitHub Pages.
*   MkDocs automatically uses the folder and file structure within `docs/` to generate the site navigation (menus).

Your website should be available shortly at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo-name>/`. You can find the exact URL in your repository's "Pages" settings once the first deployment is successful.
